                                 I grew up my whole life in Nashville. I went to Hall Jackson Montessori, Percy Priest, and then JT Moore where I was in the Encore program. Attended MBA for 2 years and went on to graduate from Hillsboro Comp High latter 2 years of my time there in the International Baccalaureeate program. I then went on to UTK for Global Studies and Mass Communication, then dropped out to focus on work and rethink my career trajectory. I finally made the decision to attend a bootcamp some time ago, and after an intial rejection from Nashville Software School, I was given the chance to start my career by attending Vanderbilt's Software Devlopment Bootcamp. At a campus that growing up in middle Tenneessee I never thought I would be able to attend!
